                  Usage-Based Billing or Usage-Based Pricing is a business model
                  where companies choose to charge customers based on the value
                  they receive from product usage, rather than the prevailing
                  practice of charging per user.
                </p>{" "}
                <p>
                  Companies that have adopted this model demonstrate their
                  commitment to transparency and fairness, while also seeing
                  impressive returns in the stock market. Whether they use a
                  pure transaction model or a mix of transaction and
                  subscription-based models, the underlying principle is the
                  same: users are valued based on the actual value they derive
                  from a product or service. There are numerous metrics that can
                  be used to determine the value derived by users.

                We've followed the segmentation logic provided by OpenView
                Partners and broadly bucketed the pricing models into some
                variant of Transactional or Usage-based subscription. While both
                are usage based models, Transactional models are flexible
                pricing where customers only pay for what they have used during
                the period. In the UB subscription model, customers commit to
                their desired level of usage. They can upgrade or pay overages
                for more usage. If they need less usage, they can change plans
                (subject to contract terms).
